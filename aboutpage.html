                <p>Hi, I'm John Andrew Chua, an energetic 18-year-old born on March 30, 2006. 
                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of San Carlos. Outside of academics, 
                    I love staying active by playing sports like volleyball and badminton, and I occasionally join in on a game of basketball when invited. </p>

                <p>I am currently playing for the School of Arts and Sciences (SAS) volleyball team. As a first-year student, 
                    I am thrilled to share that we became champions during the recent University Days. My main position is open spiker, 
                    but I also step in as a middle blocker when needed, even though it can be exhausting due to the intense blocking required. 
                    I rarely play opposite, as the timing can be tricky, but I am always eager to improve. While receiving isn't my strongest suit, I challenge myself by 
                    occasionally taking on the role of libero to hone my defensive skills. Volleyball has taught me the value of perseverance and adaptability, 
                    both on and off the court.</p>

                <p>Aside from volleyball, I have a deep passion for motorcycles and cars, particularly their engines, 
                    which never fail to intrigue me. When I have the time, I enjoy going on motorcycle rides to clear my mind. I ride a Honda CB500X, 
                    an adventure bike known for its 471cc parallel-twin engine, offering smooth performance and versatility for both city rides and longer adventures. 
                    Its lightweight frame and comfortable ergonomics make it perfect for stress-free riding, allowing me to focus on the journey rather than the destination. 
                    I also own a Honda Rebel 500, a cruiser-style bike that combines style, power, and comfort with its 471cc engine and low-slung seat. 
                    Riding these bikes is not just a hobby but a way to relax, recharge, and enjoy the freedom of the open road.</p>
